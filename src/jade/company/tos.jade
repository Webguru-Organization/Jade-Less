              ol
                li  Subject to these Terms of Service, DataFox will provide to DataFox clients (“
                  strong Clients
                  | ”) the Service as described in the Service Plan under which Client has registered and paid. These Terms of Service govern any free trial period as well as paid term of any Service Plan. If a Client purchases access to multiple accounts under a Service Plan, then such Client may designate the number of “
                  strong Authorized Users
                  | ” up to the number of accounts purchased. Client may only designate as Authorized Users Client’s employees, consultants, contractors and subcontractors needing to access and use the Service for Client’s internal business purposes.  Client and each of its Authorized Users are subject to these Terms of Service, Client is responsible for the compliance of these Terms of Service by its Authorized Users, and Client shall be responsible for any breach of these Terms of Service by its Authorized Users or any other Client personnel.  Where the context requires, requirements and prohibitions in these Terms of Service shall apply to both Clients and Authorized Users, even if expressed as a Client requirement or prohibition.
                li Please read our Privacy Policy (http://www.datafox.com/privacy-policy/) carefully for details relating to what information and data we collect from you and other Users, and how we use that information internally and disclose it to third parties, including but not limited to advertisers. Our Privacy Policy is incorporated into these Terms by reference.
                li DataFox will use commercially reasonable efforts to make this Site and the Service available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Client acknowledges and agrees that such availability is subject to: (a) planned maintenance downtime, and (b) any unavailability caused by urgent maintenance or circumstances beyond DataFox’s control. DataFox will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Client support as described in the Service Plan.
                li Client acknowledges and agrees that DataFox uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Service, and that the technical processing and transmission of the Service may be unencrypted, and involve transmissions over various networks and changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices.
                li DataFox reserves the right at any time to modify, augment, enhance or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof). Use of any new Service features, tools and resources are subject to these Terms of Service. Should DataFox discontinue any material feature of the Service, DataFox will promptly provide notice to Client and provide Client with an appropriate price adjustment.
                li DataFox reserves the right to change or modify these Terms of Service from time to time. Any change or modification will be effective upon posting on this Site. Client is advised to review these Terms of Service periodically to ensure compliance with the most recent terms. Client’s continued use of the Service following the posting of any change or modification of the Terms of Service will constitute Client’s acceptance of such change or modification. If Client does not agree to the amended terms of use, Client must stop accessing and using the Service.

            li CLIENT AND AUTHORIZED USER RESPONSIBILITIES
              ol
                li Authorized Users must be a human being. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted. Authorized Users must provide his/her correct legal full name, a valid email address, and any other information requested in order to complete the registration process. Personal data is collected and managed under DataFox’s Privacy Policy http://www.datafox.com/privacy-policy/
                li Each Authorized User account may only be used by one individual and is limited to four IP addresses. Multiple individuals may not use or share a single account. If DataFox determines that account sharing has occurred, DataFox reserves the right both to charge Client for each individual involved and to terminate Client’s access to the Service.
                li Client and Authorized Users are responsible for maintaining the security of Client’s account and password, and Client accepts responsibility for all activities that occur under its or its Authorized Users’ passwords. DataFox is not liable for any loss or damage resulting from Client’s or Authorized User’s failure to protect Client’s account or comply with Client’s or Authorized Users’ obligations under these Terms of Service.
                li Repeat trial account signups by a single company or affiliated companies are not allowed. DataFox reserves the right to cancel any such repeat trial accounts. Trial accounts that are not accompanied by a working phone number and email will be subject to immediate cancellation without notice.
                li Subject to Client’s compliance with these Terms of Service, DataFox grants Client (i) a limited, non-assignable, revocable right to access and use the Service for Client’s informational and internal business use only, and (ii) a limited, non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicensable license to download, print and use DataFox Content for internal business use only. “
                  strong DataFox Content
                  | ” includes data records of companies, the format and presentation of such data, and any other text, charts, graphics, commentary, derived insights and other information created and made available by DataFox.
                li Client and Authorized Users are not permitted to: (i) reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, lease or distribute the Service or DataFox Content, in whole or in part, to any third party; (ii) publicly perform or display the Service or DataFox Content, in whole or in part; (iii) modify or make any derivative uses of the Service or DataFox Content, in whole or in part; (iv) use any manual or automated data mining, scraping, crawling, spiders, robots or similar data gathering or extraction methods on any webpage, screen or other content contained in, generated by or relating to the Service; (v) introduce or transmit any worms, viruses, malware or any code of a destructive nature onto or via the Service; (vi) download (other than the page caching) any portion of the Service or DataFox Content, except as expressly permitted by these Terms of Service; (vii) use the Service or DataFox Content except as expressly permitted by these Terms of Service; (viii) access or use the Service for monitoring the Service’s availability, performance or functionality, or for any other benchmarking or competitive purposes; or (ix) conduct any activity using the Service or DataFox Content that is illegal or in violation of any applicable laws and regulations, including, without limitation, all national, state, local and other laws and regulations relating to physical mailing, emailing or spam.
                li Any use of the Service or DataFox Content other than as specifically authorized herein, without the prior written permission of DataFox, is strictly prohibited and will result in the immediate termination of Client’s account and any granted authorization or license to the Service and DataFox Content. Such unauthorized use may also violate applicable laws including without limitation copyright and trademark laws. Unless explicitly stated herein, nothing in these Terms of Service will be construed as conferring any license to intellectual property rights, whether by estoppel, implication or otherwise.
                li Client shall indemnify, defend and hold DataFox and its employees, managers, officers, and agents (collectively, the “
                  strong Indemnities
                  | ”) harmless from and against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against an Indemnity by a third party (i) arising out of Client’s or Authorized Users’ use of the Service or DataFox Content in violation of these Terms of Service or of applicable laws, rules, or regulations, or (ii) alleging that any Client Content or Client’s or Authorized Users’ unauthorized use of the Service or DataFox Content infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or proprietary rights of a third party. Client shall indemnify DataFox from and against any related damages, losses, liabilities, expenses, attorney fees and costs.
                li Client is permitted no more than the number of company profile synchronizations (aka lead exports) per month to Client’s CRM, and no more than the number of results views in list form pursuant to the Service, as are specifically provided for in the Service Plan under which Client has registered and paid, as determined by DataFox in its discretion. Such numbers are maximums only. Client does not have the right to carry forward, or obtain credit for, or provide to others, any unused lead exports or result views in any month. If Client requires access to more data than allowed under Client’s Service Plan, Client may contact DataFox to upgrade its Service Plan. In no event shall Client or an Authorized User provide any leads or information (or any information in or extracted from or derived from any leads) to any third party, even if Client or Authorized User has exported and stored such leads or information in or to another platform.


            li THIRD PARTY CONTENT AND APPS
              ol
                li Client understands that the Service gathers, organizes and derives insights on companies based on available information and data provided by third parties or contributed by Clients (together, “
                  strong Third Party Content
                  | ”). DataFox does not pre-screen Third Party Content that may be presented or available through the Service. DataFox has the right in its sole discretion to limit, restrict or remove any Third Party Content from the Service. DataFox makes no claim or representation regarding, and accepts no responsibility for, the quality, content, nature or reliability of any Third Party Content. DataFox does not represent or warrant the accuracy of any Third Party Content, undertakes no responsibility to update or review any Third Party Content, and makes no guarantee as to the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of any Third Party Content. Providing Third Party Content or attribution to the source of any Third Party Content does not imply affiliation, endorsement or adoption by DataFox of the Third Party Content or Third Party Content provider. In the event that a Third Party Content provider requires DataFox to remove or discontinue use of any Third Party Content, DataFox may in turn direct Client to cease using such Third Party Content and expunge it from Client’s platforms. Client agrees to comply promptly with any such direction.
                li Third party applications or services (“
                  strong Third Party Apps
                  | ”) may be available through the Service. DataFox does not warrant, and is not responsible for the legality, quality, accuracy, integrity, fitness, reliability, or availability of any Third Party Apps that Client may connect to through or with the Service, or any descriptions or promises related to such Third Party Apps. Client’s agreement to use such Third Party Apps will be solely between Client and such Third Party App provider.
                li If Client installs or enables Third Party Apps for use with the Service, or accesses the Service from the Third Party Apps, Client acknowledges and agrees that: (i) DataFox may access and use Client data and basic account information, and may allow such Third Party Apps providers to access Client’s data for provisioning or interoperation of the Third Party Apps with the Service; (ii) Client is solely responsible for ensuring that it has obtained all necessary rights, licenses and authorizations from the Third Party App provider; and (iii) DataFox will not be responsible for any disclosure, modification or deletion of Client’s data by a Third Party App provider. If Client obtains any custom data via Third Party Apps through the Service, Client is responsible for obtaining all necessary rights, licenses and authorizations to use such custom data, and to authorize DataFox to host, transmit and display such custom data. If Client does not want to permit the exchange of Client’s data or account information with Third Party Apps, Client should not enable or should disable such Third Party Apps for use with the Service.
                li The Service may provide links to third-party websites (“
                  strong Third Party Sites
                  | ”) where Client may obtain Third Party Content. DataFox makes no claim or representation regarding, and accepts no responsibility for, the quality, content, nature or reliability of any Third Party Sites, or Third Party Sites linking to the Service. Such Third Party Sites are not under the control of DataFox and DataFox is not responsible for any Third Party Site, any content, links or services on such Third Party Site, or any review, changes or updates to a Third Party Site. DataFox provides links to Third Party Sites to Client only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply affiliation, endorsement or adoption by DataFox of any Third Party Site or any information contained therein. When Client leaves this Site, Client understands that the terms and policies of the provider of the Third Party Site, not those of DataFox, will govern  Client’s use of the Third Party Site.  Client should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third Party Site to which Client navigates. DataFox does not monitor or have any control over any Third Party Site.
                li Client shall indemnify, defend and hold DataFox and its employees, managers, officers, and agents (collectively, the “
                  strong Indemnities
                  | ”)  harmless from and against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against an Indemnity by a third party arising out of Client’s use of Third Party Content, Third Party Apps including data from such Third Party Apps, and Third Party Sites, and any claim that Client’s use of Third Party Content, Third Party Apps including data from such Third Party Apps, or Third Party Sites, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or proprietary rights of another party or violates any law, rule or regulation. Client shall indemnify Indemnities from and against any related damages, losses, liabilities, expenses, attorney fees and costs.
                li DataFox may run advertisements and promotions from third parties on the Service or may otherwise provide information about or links to third-party products or services. Client’s dealings or correspondence with, or participation in promotions of, such third parties, and any terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings or promotions, are solely between Client and such third party. DataFox is not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred by Client as the result of any Client’s dealings with or reliance on any such third party advertising, promotions or information.

            li CONFIDENTIALITY
              ol
                li “
                  strong Confidential Information
                  | ” means information disclosed by a party (“
                  strong Discloser
                  |”) to the other party (“
                  strong Recipient
                  |”) that is marked “
                  strong Confidential
                  |,” or that is confirmed in writing to be confidential within 10 days of oral disclosure. DataFox’s Confidential Information includes the Service, DataFox Content and any business, product and service information not publicly known. Confidential Information does not include any information that: (i) is or becomes publicly known through no fault of the Recipient; (ii) was known to the Recipient prior to disclosure by Discloser without violation of any confidentiality obligation to Discloser; (iii) is received by Recipient from a third party with no duty of confidentiality; or (iv) is independently developed by Recipient.
                li Recipient will use the same degree of care to protect Discloser’s Confidential Information that it uses to protect its own confidential information, but no less than reasonable care. Unless authorized by Discloser, Recipient shall only use Confidential Information as needed to perform under this agreement, and shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party except to Recipient’s personnel and subcontractors requiring the Confidential Information to perform under this agreement and who are bound by written confidentiality obligations with respect to the Confidential Information. Recipient may disclose Confidential Information if compelled by law to do so, but will promptly give Discloser notice of such compelled disclosure as permitted by law.


            li PAYMENT
              ol
                li Client will not be charged for the trial period starting from the date of the creation of Client’s account. Charges will begin to accrue on the day after the trial period ends.   Client payments shall be non-refundable, except as provided in these Terms of Service or Client’s service agreement.
                li Unless otherwise stated, DataFox’s fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including but not limited to value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any local, state, provincial, federal or foreign jurisdiction (collectively, “
                  strong Taxes
                  | ”). Client is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with Service purchases. If DataFox has the obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Client is responsible, the appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Client, unless Client provides DataFox with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.

            li REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS
              ol
                li Each party represents that it has the legal authority to enter into this agreement and to abide by these Terms of Service.
                li CLIENT’S USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT CLIENT’S SOLE RISK. THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS. DataFox does not represent or warrant that: (i) the Service will meet Client’s specific requirements; (ii) the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; (iii) the results that may be obtained from the use of the Service will be accurate, timely or reliable; (iv) the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by Client through the Service will meet Client expectations; or (v) any errors in the Service will be corrected. In particular, DataFox makes no representations or warranties of any kind with respect to any Third Party Content, Third Party Apps or Third Party Sites.
                li EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, NEITHER PARTY MAKES ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

            li LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
              ol
                li NOTWITHSTANDING ANY PROVISION TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, DATAFOX’S TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY TO CLIENT FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND UNDER ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO AND WILL NOT EXCEED AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE FEES PAID TO DATAFOX BY CLIENT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE 12-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
                li CLIENT EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT DATAFOX WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, EVEN IF DATAFOX HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, CLIENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT DATAFOX WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR CUSTOMER’S USE OF OR RELIANCE ON ANY INFORMATION OBTAINED THROUGH THE SERVICES. THE ABOVE LIMITATION WILL APPLY TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
                li The parties expressly acknowledge and agree that DataFox has set its fees and entered into the agreement to provide the Service in reliance upon the limitations of liability specified herein, which allocate the risk between Client and DataFox and form a basis of the bargain between the parties.


            li TERM AND TERMINATION
              ol
                li Unless otherwise provided in a separate agreement, any Service Plan term will renew automatically and Client will be charged accordingly.
                li Either Party has the right to immediately terminate the use of the Service, and the license rights provided hereunder, if the other Party breaches any provision of these Terms of Service and fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days after receiving written notice of the breach.
                li DataFox, in its sole discretion, has the right to suspend or terminate Client’s account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Service, or any other DataFox service, for any reason at any time. Such termination for convenience of the Service will result in the deactivation, deletion or denial of access to Client’s account. DataFox reserves the right to refuse to provide the Service to anyone for any reason at any time. In the event of termination for convenience by DataFox, Client will be entitled to a refund of fees paid, pro-rated for the remainder of any Service Plan term.
                li Upon any termination or cancellation of Client’s account, Client will promptly (i) cease using the Service; and (ii) cease using and will expunge any DataFox Content and Third Party Content on Client’s platform obtained from the Service as may be required by DataFox.
                li The rights and obligations of the parties contained in Sections 2(h), 3(e), 4, 5, 7, 8, 9(e) and 10 will survive the termination or cancellation of Client’s account and access to the Service under these Terms of Service.


            li General
              ol
                li Client may not assign its rights and obligations under these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without DataFox’s express prior written consent; provided, however, Client may assign this agreement to an Client Affiliate as defined below. Any attempt to assign this Agreement, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns. DataFox may assign this Agreement without Customer’s consent to any purchaser of substantially all the assets or equity of DataFox (including by merger), provided any assignee fulfills the DataFox obligations set forth in these Terms of Service. For purposes of this Agreement, “
                  strong Client Affiliate
                  | ” shall mean any other entity that, directly or indirectly, controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with Client.
                li These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California excluding conflict of laws principles. The parties expressly agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California and the parties hereby irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.
                li Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Service, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies hereunder will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms of Service or otherwise. The failure by either party to enforce any provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.
                li If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Service invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect.
                li All notices required or permitted under these Terms of Service will be in writing and delivered by courier or overnight delivery services, by electronic mail, or by certified mail, and in each instance will be deemed given upon receipt.
