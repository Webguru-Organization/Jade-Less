Client and each of its Authorized Users are subject to these Terms of Service, Client is responsible for the compliance of these Terms of Service by its Authorized Users, and Client shall be responsible for any breach of these Terms of Service by its Authorized Users or any other Client personnel.  Where the context requires, requirements and prohibitions in these Terms of Service shall apply to both Clients and Authorized Users, even if expressed as a Client requirement or prohibition.</li><li>Please read our Privacy Policy (http://www.datafox.com/privacy-policy/) carefully for details relating to what information and data we collect from you and other Users, and how we use that information internally and disclose it to third parties, including but not limited to advertisers.

DataFox does not represent or warrant the accuracy of any Third Party Content, undertakes no responsibility to update or review any Third Party Content, and makes no guarantee as to the accuracy, timeliness or completeness of any Third Party Content. Providing Third Party Content or attribution to the source of any Third Party Content does not imply affiliation, endorsement or adoption by DataFox of the Third Party Content or Third Party Content provider. In the event that a Third Party Content provider requires DataFox to remove or discontinue use of any Third Party Content, DataFox may in turn direct Client to cease using such Third Party Content and expunge it from Client’s platforms. Client agrees to comply promptly with any such direction.</li><li>Third party applications or services (“<strong>Third Party Apps</strong>”) may be available through the Service. DataFox does not warrant, and is not responsible for the legality, quality, accuracy, integrity, fitness, reliability, or availability of any Third Party Apps that Client may connect to through or with the Service, or any descriptions or promises related to such Third Party Apps.

If Client does not want to permit the exchange of Client’s data or account information with Third Party Apps, Client should not enable or should disable such Third Party Apps for use with the Service.</li><li>The Service may provide links to third-party websites (“<strong>Third Party Sites</strong>”) where Client may obtain Third Party Content.

DataFox provides links to Third Party Sites to Client only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply affiliation, endorsement or adoption by DataFox of any Third Party Site or any information contained therein. When Client leaves this Site, Client understands that the terms and policies of the provider of the Third Party Site, not those of DataFox, will govern  Client’s use of the Third Party Site.  Client should review the applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third Party Site to which Client navigates. DataFox does not monitor or have any control over any Third Party Site.</li><li>Client shall indemnify, defend and hold DataFox and its employees, managers, officers, and agents (collectively, the “<strong>Indemnities</strong>”)  harmless from and against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against an Indemnity by a third party arising out of Client’s use of Third Party Content, Third Party Apps including data from such Third Party Apps, and Third Party Sites, and any claim that Client’s use of Third Party Content, Third Party Apps including data from such Third Party Apps, or Third Party Sites, infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or proprietary rights of another party or violates any law, rule or regulation. Client shall indemnify Indemnities from and against any related damages, losses, liabilities, expenses, attorney fees and costs.</li><li>DataFox may run advertisements and promotions from third parties on the Service or may otherwise provide information about or links to third-party products or services. Client’s dealings or correspondence with, or participation in promotions of, such third parties, and any terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings or promotions, are solely between Client and such third party.

Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of each party's successors and permitted assigns.
